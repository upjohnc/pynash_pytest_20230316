# Basic Test

Using pytest, tests are as simple as having the right name and an `assert`.

- pytest naming:
    - looks for functions' names that start with `test_` or end with `_test`
    - in file with test in the name: `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.
- the `assert` is the check if the test passes or fails.  If boolean check is True then the test passes else fails.
